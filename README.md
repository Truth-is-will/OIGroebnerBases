# OIGroebnerBases - A Macaulay2 Package
## NOTE: Currently being updated to v2.0.0. For the lastest working version, see [v1.0.5](https://github.com/morrowmh/OIGroebnerBases/tree/4b8a4ae59d11d11d3963d053e4bcbeaf9358f3df).
## Introduction
This Macaulay2 package allows one to compute Gr√∂bner bases, syzygies and free resolutions for submodules of free OI-modules over Noetherian polynomial OI-algebras. For an introduction to the topic, see [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09247v2).
## Installation and Documentation
Download the file `OIGroebnerBases.m2` from the top directory and launch an instance of Macaulay2 in the same directory as the package. Then install the package by running the command
```Macaulay2
installPackage "OIGroebnerBases"
```
View the documentation by running
```Macaulay2
viewHelp OIGroebnerBases
```
To load the package in the future, run
```Macaulay2
needsPackage "OIGroebnerBases"
```
